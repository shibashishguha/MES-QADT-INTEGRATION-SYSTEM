I built an application to facilitate the integration of the Manufacturing Execution System (MES) server with the Quality Analysis and Data Transmission (QADT) server, and to post material quality data back to SAP. The application ensures seamless data exchange between MES and QADT servers, handles data mapping to SAP's structure, and automates the posting process for accuracy and timeliness. After each heat cycle, the application matches the MES data of the end products with the required material specifications mentioned in the QADT system, displaying green signals for matches and red signals for mismatches. If all signals are green, indicating all specifications are met, the end product data from the MES system is posted to SAP. The application includes features for thorough testing and debugging, as well as monitoring tools to track data flow and resolve issues promptly. Designed with a user-friendly interface, it simplifies the integration process and includes comprehensive documentation on system architecture and troubleshooting procedures. This project provided me with hands-on experience in system integration, data management, and automation within a steel production environment.
